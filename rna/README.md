## Projects' final folder, for Vigenere cipher with LSTM
# vigenere cipher decoder
Toy problem for CSCI 4911 capstone project

## Purpose
Gain a better understanding of Pytorch, Tensorflow, and training an LSTM.

## Getting Started
Fork repository, must use Python3 and Pip or Conda.

### Prerequisites
Tensorflow and Pytorch must be installed.

### Building
Must be in the file tree in order to execute.


### Files
* logger.py: tensorboard log without using tensorflow
* mul_layer_mul_batch_lstm.py: lstm model and training script
* neural_networks_tutorial.py: PyTorch tutorial for Neural Net
* pre_process.py: read in the encrypted and plain text as data and pass it onto lstm file.
* vigenere/data/: csv datafiles
* vigenere/data_create.py: create data csv based on random keys and plan text
* logs/: training run logs for tensorboard, empty as of now
