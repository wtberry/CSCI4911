# CSCI 4911 Capstone Project

CSCI 4911, Hawaii Pacific University class project collaborated with [Oceanit](https://www.oceanit.com/)

Main goal was applying machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning(RL) and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) 
to RNA.

We've started with Toy problems, to get familiar with the library (PyTorch) and the algorithms.

## Toy Problems
### LSTM
* Long Short Term Memory applied for vigenere cipher decryption with key
